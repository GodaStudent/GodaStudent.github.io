              Hello, I am Goda Riepšaitė, and I am a Psychology student at LCC International University in Lithuania. While I am not the most active person, one of my most favored activities is traveling. Either all around my own country or exploring new cultures in other countries. I started traveling quite young with my family, and over the years I had a chance to explore countries and their cultures all around the world. Therefore, in this blog, I would like to share with you my experiences and impressions about a few of the countries that I have visited. While also advising on a few of the places people might like to visit while traveling there.
